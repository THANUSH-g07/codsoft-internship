# TASK 1: credit card fraud detection

Credit Card Fraud Detection Import all modules. Load the dataset. Dropping irrelevant columns. Apply Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data. Fit and Predict. Print Accuracy. Accuracy: 1.0

# TASK 2 : Movie genre classification

Movie Genre Classsification Import all modules. Load the dataset. Dropping irrelevant columns. Preprocessing data so textual data can be trained, since genre classification is based on plot summary of the movie and other featuers such as movie name, cast, etc. Apply Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed data via inversing the labelencodings done while preprocessing. Fit and Predict. Print Accuracy. Accuracy: 0.54

# TASK 3 : Customer churn prediction

Customer Churn Prediction Import all modules. Load the dataset. Assigning X and y. X is dataset without the churn ie 'exited' column. Y is the churn ie 'exited' column Split the data into training and testing sets. List all columns in either categorical or numeric list. Preprocessing the data by applying standard scaling on numeric columns and ignoring unknown data from categorical columns. Apply Logistic Regression classifier on the preprocessed data via pipeline. Fit and Predict. Apply Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data via pipeline. Fit and Predict. Apply Gradient Boosting classifier on the preprocessed data via pipeline. Fit and Predict. Print Accuracy of each. Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.811 Random Forest Accuracy: 0.8435 Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 0.863
